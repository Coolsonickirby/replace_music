# Ultimate Music Replacement Mod

A Skyline plugin for replacing stream files (music, movies) with files of arbitrary size.

Mod files go in the following location:
```
/atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/romfs/stream/
```
For example, you can replace the menu music by placing a .nus3audio file here:
```
/atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/romfs/stream/sound/bgm/bgm_crs2_01_menu.nus3audio
```
