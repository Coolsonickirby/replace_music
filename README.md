# Ultimate Music Replacement Mod

A Skyline plugin for replacing stream files (music, videos) with files of arbitrary size.

Files go in the following location:
```
    /atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/romfs/stream
```

For example you can replace the menu music by placing a nus3audio file here:
```
    /atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/romfs/stream/sound/bgm/bgm_crs2_01_menu.nus3bank
```
